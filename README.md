# GameController_Macropad

Use a game controller on Windows as a macropad, primarily to control audio functions quickly & easily and launch applications.

There are probalby other, perhaps better, ways to accomplish this.  I did not exhaustivly investigate the the univsere of options,  I just came across a [good starting point](http://www.duckduckgo.com), tweaked it to meet my needs, and found it worked pretty well.  

You'll want to run this in an editor and modify the button mappings to reflect what makes the most sense in your situation.
